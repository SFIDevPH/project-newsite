        <p>Evolve swim is the epitome of a world class learn to swim offering here in Doha. We have a commitment to providing the community with the opportunity to learn a vital life skill, facilitating learning in a fun, safe and supportive environment. We aim to support all swimmers in their water confidence journey allowing them to progress and feel nurtured, swimmers come away from our programs having mastered exceptional swimming technique and have enjoyed their swimming experiences.</p>
        <p>The Evolve learn to swim program starts with early years, a program tailored for babies and toddlers from three months of age up until three years. We encourage enrolment in to our early years program and highly recommend exposing children to the water as early as possible; early years provides the perfect bonding opportunity for parents and water guardians and allows a smooth transition in to our Pre-School program.</p>
        <p>Our Pre-School program is offered to children from three to four years of age, teaching fundamental movement skills and introducing the core aquatics skills, that will eventually be the foundations of their strokes throughout the learn to swim stages. The core ‘Learn to Swim’ program is offered to children from four years of age, for children that feel they are ready to move on from the support of their parent or water guardian. Class ratios are small, and we pride ourselves on the quality that is delivered during our sessions.</p>
        <p>Our swimmers are continually assessed and are only taught by fully qualified aquatics instructors, swimmers are rewarded certificates at the end of each swim term and report cards are written to highlight areas of achievement and areas that we will continue to work on, in order to progress up the learn to swim pathway.</p>
