        <p>Meditating does not have to mean you live in a mountain secluded from society. We believe, a person who meditates regularly has the capacity to function in daily life with more effectiveness and efficiency inspite of the stresses of modern society.</p>
        <p>The Pranic Healing System offiers a range of meditations for anyone looking to relieve stress to someone who wants to take their meditation practice to a deeper and higher level. through the Arhatic Yoga® Sytem created by Master Choa Kok Sui.  </p>
        <p>From the short (20 minutes) but powerful foundational Meditation on Twin Hearts, to monthly Full Moon Meditations and the more powerful Arhatic Yoga meditations, you can learn a variety of exercises to keep you calm and grounded, while increasing your connection to your higher self.</p>
        <p>For those who wish to increase their understanding of the principles behind Pranic Healing, there is available a series of advanced courses and meditations.  But this is not training for the “would-be monk”; this is spirituality and self-development for the modern world, where people have to make a living and have very practical considerations on their mind.  This is ancient wisdom updated and made practical for busy modern world, but w/o sacrificing the power and truth of the teachings.  For instance, they include simple and understandable clarifications on much-used and much-misunderstood terms, such as “karma,” “kundalini,” “reincarnation,” the “Four Noble Truths,” the “Eight-Fold Path” and more.</p>
